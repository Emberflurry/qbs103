```{r}
# ?function ie ?print to show all the params/etc

x<-c(1,2,3,4,5)

#integers vec
#<- as.integer(c(1,2,))
#as.character(c("a",
#c(TRUE,FALSE

#mixed vec:
#c(1,"a") turns into ("1","a")

#class/datatype:
class(x)


length(x)


#mult: *

#1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 * 2,2,2,2 = 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 lol - since multiple of #length, circles back lmfao

#typecast to int does FLOOR()

#extract values from vec/list by index:
#x is vec
#x[1] gives 1st value (NOT 2nd) indexing starts at 1

#x[c(1,3)] g 1st n 3rd val of x

#assign names to vector elements
#names(x) <- c('name1',etc

#x['name1']



#na val discov
print(is.na(x))

#val discov - which of vec are/arent things
x!=4

which(x !=4)

length(which( x !=4))

#subset vecs

xs = x[x<3]
xs

y = c("a",'b','c','d','e')
ys= y[y=='c']
ys

#FACTORS - ie gender/sex/race/categoricals
#conv ea into a level
g=c('f','f','f','f','f','m','m','m')
gf = factor(g,levels=c('f','m'))
class(gf)
levels(gf)
table(gf)


#LISTS
L <-list(c(row1,,,,), c(row2...))
#can combine dif datatypes in a list struc

#view with str(L) gives

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
